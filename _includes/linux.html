    <li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
      <br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. LibreOffice comes
      preinstalled with several Linux distributions. If you don't already have it, use
      your package manager to install it: (e.g., <code>sudo apt-get install
	libreoffice</code> for Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions).
</ul>

<!--
<li><b>OpenRefine</b>
  <br>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning that runs
  through a web browser, and any browser - Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer -
  should work fine.  You will need to download Google Refine and install it, and
  when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need an
  internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.
  <ul>
    <li>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download
	page</a>
    <li>Click on <i>Linux kit</i> to download the install file
    <li>Download and extract
    <li>Type <code>./refine</code> in your terminal and Google Refine will then
    open in your web browser.
    <li>If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started
      the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should
      see OpenRefine.
  </ul>

  <li><b>R</b>
    <br>In the workshop, we will use RStudio. RStudio is a nice interface to the
    programming language R. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.
    <ul>
      <li>Follow the instructions for your distribution
	from <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/">CRAN</a>. For most distributions, you
	can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run <code>sudo
	apt-get install r-base</code>, and for Fedora run <code>sudo yum install
	R</code>) but make sure that you have at least R 3.2.2 (as pre-packaged
	versions might be out of date).
      <li>To install RStudio, go to
	the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio Download
	  page</a>
      <li>Under <i>Installers</i> select the version for your distribution.
      <li>Once it's downloaded, double click the file to install it (or <code>sudo dpkg
	  -i rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb</code> at the terminal).
      <li>Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.
    </ul>

  <li><b>SQLite</b>
    <br>
    For this workshop we're going to use the Firefox SQLite Plugin. It works through
    the web browser Firefox.
    <ul>
      <li>If you don't already have Firefox installed
	<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">install Firefox</a>
      <li>Start Firefox
      <li>Go to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">plugin homepage</a>.
      <li> Click the "Add Now" button.
      <li> Click "Install Now" on the dialog that appears after the download completes.
      <li> Restart Firefox when prompted.
